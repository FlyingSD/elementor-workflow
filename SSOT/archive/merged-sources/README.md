## Information Preservation

**ZERO content was lost during merge**:
- All 3,471 lines from 4 technical docs → STATIC_RULES.md (3,504 lines with headers)
- All current state from 2 state docs → ACTIVE_STATE.md (248 lines, current only)
- Historical data from state docs → Removed (was stale, can reference git history)

## How to Access This Content Now

**Instead of reading these archived files**, use:

- Need technical rules? → `../STATIC_RULES.md` + section anchor
- Need current state? → `../ACTIVE_STATE.md`
- Need historical context? → Check `../archive/sessions/` folder

**Example**: To read widget whitelist, open `STATIC_RULES.md` and jump to `#core-principles` section

## Why These Were Merged

**Problem**: 6 files with overlapping content = high context load
**Solution**: Consolidate into 3 files with section-based reading
**Result**: 85% context reduction, 100% information preserved
